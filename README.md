### The Problem statement
1. Being a farmer is not an easy job. They work from dawn to dusk, in the fields, so that they can cultivate the crops for us to consume. They are one of the most important contributors to the economy of the country. So in our opinion one must always look at ways to improve their lives.
2. Some of the problems the Farmers face:
    * Unlike the  consumer goods where the producers determine the base price of the goods, the farmers don’t decide the selling price of the goods, and they don’t even have an idea of it. 
    * The farmer’s produce has to go through a long chain of middlemen before it reaches the buyer/consumer. As it passes through each intermediate, the price of the crop increases. This profit which is generated by these intermediates does not reach the farmer. 


### Proposed Solution
Team DoubleAPI have come up with **Crop-Canal**, a web portal that helps improve the logistics innvolved in the communications between the traders and farmers.
This web-portal helps reduce the gap between the market and the farmers. Our entire system is based on trust. The trader entrusts our application to impose a quality check on the crops provided by the farmer and the farmer in turn trusts to get his crop sold at the best possible price which is ensured through the bidding system. 


### Functioning of the WebApp
1. The farmer will upload 5 pictures of their crops to the WebApp. These pictures are then fed into the Crop Analyser Model which not only identifies the crop, the farmer intends to sell, but also checks for the quality of the crop, and they are assigned a score.
2. The farmer can then quote a desired price at which he is willing to sell his crop. This price will not be revealed to the traders.
3. The traders who are interested in buying the crops can start bidding for the crops. Once the bidding amount reaches the price quoted by the farmer, he will receive a message on *Telegram* regarding the same. It is then upto the farmer to decide whether to close the auction or let it continue.

## Tech Stacks:
* For the frontend we've used plain HTML, CSS along with Bootstrap.
* For Machine learning we have used Pytorch as our framework to make multiple image processing models.
* For the backend we are using flask as our microframe work.
* Flask RestFul for APIs
* SQL databases to manage farmer/Trader details.

### ToDo 
- [ ] Integrate the Frontend with the BlockChain Backend
- [ ] Work on Improving the UI
- [ ] Integrate Trader Authentication (PAN)
- [ ] Telegram integration for notifications to the farmer
